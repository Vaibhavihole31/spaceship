  <summary>What is GitHub?</summary>

**GitHub:** GitHub is a web-based platform that acts as a central hub for managing and tracking changes to computer code using a version control system called Git. It provides a collaborative environment for software developers to work on projects, share code, and keep track of modifications made by team members.

  <summary>What is the difference between Git and GitHub?</summary>

  <p>

1.  Git is a version control system, while GitHub is a platform for hosting Git repositories.

2.  Git allows users to manage and track changes to their codebase while GitHub allows multiple developers to work on the same project, contribute code, and collaborate seamlessly.

3.  Git is typically used locally on a developer's machine and can operate independently of any online platform.

  <summary>How to track changes in Git? And what is staging area?</summary>

Using the version control system to maintain up to date on changes to your codebase is part of tracking changes in Git. The following steps are usually involved in the process:

**_Initialize a Git repository:_**

1. To create a new Git repository, use `git init` in the project directory.
   Add files to the staging area

**_Add files to the staging area:_**

1. Before submitting changes, you must add the files you need to the repository. To add a particular file to the repository, use the command `git add <fileName>`, as well as `git add .` (to add all  modification)

**_Commit changes:_**

1. After adding files to the staging area, commit the changes using` git commit -m "Your commit message"`. This creates a snapshot of the files in the repository.

  <summary>What is commit in Git?</summary>
   <ul>
   <li>In Git, committing changes is similar to taking a current photo of your project.</li>
   <li>All the changes and updates you made to your files are recorded and maintained in the Git repository.</li>
   <li>So, to explain it simply, committing via Git is the same as recording and maintaining the current condition of your files at the time of the commit. </li>
   </ul>

**_Staging Changes:_**

1. Before making a commit, you stage the changes using the git add command.
