A folder structure is a hierarchical system you use to organize your files. The goal is to have every file (document, photos, etc.) neatly stored in a designated folder—steering clear of standalone files floating around—for faster access.

## Rules

1. Always use lower case when naming files and folders.
2. Don't use spaces in file and folder names (use a dash instead).
3. Only use the characters [a-z], the numbers [0-9] and the dash/hyphen [-]

## Folder Structure

The folder structure in HTML is how you arrange the files and folders in your project.

<img src="/icp/22/output-11.png" alt="output-11" width="600px"/>

### Folder Structure in VS-code

<img src="/icp/22/output-12.png" alt="output-12" width="600px"/>

### After Exapanding folders

<img src="/icp/22/output-13.png" alt="output-13" width="600px"/>

## Step:1

Handeling vs-code for folder structure.

<img src="/css/13/output4.png" alt="img-2" width="700px"/>

## Step:2

<img src="/css/13/output5.png" alt="img-2" width="700px"/>

Creating the file **index.html**.
The index file is nothing but the file of your project's homepage.

## Step:3

<img src="/css/13/output6.png" alt="img-2" width="700px"/>

In this step we created the folder for css files, in this folder all the files of css are stored. The name of file should refer it's page.

## Step:4

<img src="/css/13/output7.png" alt="img-2" width="600px"/>

For storing the images or pictures which are used in the project, we created the folder **img**. With the help of this folder it is easy to access the images with their respective pages, as shown in the above image.

## Step:5

<img src="/css/13/output8.png" alt="img-2" width="600px"/>

The above image refers the next folder which is created i.e. **icons**.
In this folder the icons are stored which are used in more than one page of the project. This folder helps to reduces the path conflicts of the files.

## Step:6

<img src="/css/13/output9.png" alt="img-2" width="600px"/>

In this step one more folder is added named as **pages**.
In this folder all the pages except the index page are stored. example: `contact.html`, `about.html`, etc

## Result

**At last the folder structure looks like:**

<img src="/css/13/output9.png" alt="img-2" width="600px"/>

:::tip
The file `index.html` should not present in any folder, it always present outside (alone - as shown in the above images).
