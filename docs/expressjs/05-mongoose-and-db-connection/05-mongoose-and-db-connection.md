## Introduction To MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database system that provides high scalability, flexibility, and performance for managing large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data.

There are two types of database:

1.  NoSQL
2.  SQL

MongoDB belongs to the NoSQL category, which means that it utilizes a non-relational data model for storing and managing data, So we Will use MongoDB database.

## MongoDB Data Structure

MongoDB organizes data in a flexible and scalable manner. Here are the key components:

1. `Key-Value`: MongoDB stores data in documents, which are JSON-like objects consisting of key-value pairs. Each value can be of different types, such as strings, numbers, arrays, or even nested documents.
2. `Document`: A document in MongoDB is a set of key-value pairs. It is equivalent to a record or row in a relational database.
3. `Collection`: A collection is a group of related documents. It is analogous to a table in a relational database. Collections do not enforce a strict schema, allowing for flexibility in the structure of the stored documents.
