# Introduction to Backend (ExpressJS)

Backend refers to the server-side development of web applications. It involves creating and maintaining the server, application, and database that together form the  foundational architecture of a web application.

## Needs of backend :

- Managing database operations.
- Handling business logic.
- Role based authentication.
- Serving responses to the client side.

**Managing Database Operations :**
Backend manages how data is stored, retrieved, updated, and deleted in the database. It ensures data is organized and accessible for the application to use.

**Handling Business Logic :**
Backend processes and applies rules to data. It performs calculations, makes decisions based on rules (like pricing or discounts), and ensures data is accurate and valid.

**Role based authentication :**
Backend controls who can access what in the application. It verifies user identities, assigns roles (like admin or user), and allows different levels of access based on those roles.

**Serving responses to the client side :**
Backend responds to requests from the client (like a web browser) with the right information. It formats data into a usable form (like JSON), handles errors, and ensures the client gets what it needs to display or use.
