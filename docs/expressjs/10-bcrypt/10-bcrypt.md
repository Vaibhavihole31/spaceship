## What is bcrypt ?

Bcrypt is a tool that turns `passwords into secret codes` (hashes) and adds a random value `(salt)` to make each password `unique`. This keeps passwords safe by making them hard to crack, even if someone finds the code.

## Bcrypt Use Cases for Password Security

### 1. Secure Login Systems

- Stores hashed passwords instead of plain text.
- At login, the password is re-hashed and checked against the stored hash.

### 2. Protection from Data Breaches

- Even if a database is hacked, hashed passwords canâ€™t be easily reversed.

### 3. Stops Rainbow Table Attacks.

- A rainbow table attack is when hackers use a list of `pre-made password hashes ` to guess passwords quickly.

- Bcrypt stops this by adding a random value `(salt)` to each password, making every hash `unique` and harder to guess.

### 4. Slows Down Brute-Force Attacks.

- It takes extra time to hash, making guessing passwords much slower.

### How to use bcrypt package ?

#### 1. Install `bcrypt` package by command given below.

```js
npm install bcrypt
```

##### 2. Hash a Password

```js
import bcrypt form "bcrypt"

const saltRounds = 10;
const plainPassword = "user_password123";

async function hashPassword() {
  const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds);
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, salt);
  console.log("Hashed Password:", hashedPassword);
}
hashPassword();
```

1. Import Bcrypt: The bcrypt library is loaded to handle password hashing.
2. saltRounds: This sets how strong (and slow) the hashing process should be. The higher the number, the more secure but slower it is.
3. plainPassword: This is the password that we want to secure (in this case, "user_password123").
4. hashPassword function

- Generate Salt: The bcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds) function creates a random value (salt) to make the password hash unique.
- Hash Password: The bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, salt) function combines the plain password with the salt to create a secure hash.
- Print Hashed Password: Finally, the hashed password is shown on the screen.

#### 3. Verify a Password

To compare a password during login

```js
import bcrypt form "bcrypt"

const hashedPasswordFromDB = "$2b$10$A1B2C3D4E5...";

async function verifyPassword(inputPassword) {
  const match = await bcrypt.compare(inputPassword, hashedPasswordFromDB);
  if (match) {
    console.log("Password is correct!");
  } else {
    console.log("Invalid password!");
  }
}

verifyPassword("user_password123");
```

#### 1. hashedPasswordFromDB: This is an example of a stored hashed password in the database.

#### 2. verifyPassword function:

- inputPassword: The password entered by the user (e.g., "user_password123").
- _Compare Password:_ `bcrypt.compare(inputPassword, hashedPasswordFromDB)` checks if the entered password matches the stored hashed password.

#### 3. Print Result:

- If the password matches, it prints: "Password is correct!"
- If it doesnâ€™t match, it prints: "Invalid password!"

#### 4. Function Call: verifyPassword("user_password123") runs the function and checks the entered password against the stored hash.
